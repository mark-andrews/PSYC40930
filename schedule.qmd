## Introduction to Python (2 weeks)

- Install and set up Python, Positron IDE, Quarto.
- Introduction to core Python and Python for science (numpy, pandas, etc).


## Introduction to machine learning with Python (2 weeks)

- Scikit-learn pipelines, stratified splits, cross-validation, leakage control.
- Logistic regression and naive Bayes; metrics: ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, confusion matrix.

This section ends with a formative assessment: 4-page binary classifier with baseline comparison.

## Introduction to deep learning (3 weeks)

- PyTorch tensors, autograd, optimisers, and training loops.
- MLP for tabular and 1D-CNN or small CNN for images or time series.
- Regularisation, early stopping, and learning-curve diagnostics; non-DL baseline comparison.

## LLMs / GPTs (3 weeks)

- Tokenisation, byte/BPE vocab training, causal masking, and next-token loss.
- Microscopic GPT implementation and training on a small corpus.
- Use as a binary text classifier via fine-tuned head or label-probability scoring; held-out evaluation and error analysis.
