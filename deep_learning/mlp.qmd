# Overview

This Quarto document reproduces the Python script as a self-contained web page and explains each step. We will:

- Load the MNIST dataset from OpenML.
- Normalise pixel values and set appropriate data types.
- Split the data into training and test sets.
- Define a small multilayer perceptron (MLP) in PyTorch.
- Train it using skorch's `NeuralNetClassifier` wrapper.
- Evaluate accuracy on the test set.

# Imports

We import the libraries needed for data loading, splitting, model definition, and training.

```{python}
from sklearn.datasets import fetch_openml
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
import torch
from torch import nn
from skorch import NeuralNetClassifier
```

# Load and preprocess the data

We fetch MNIST (70,000 images of handwritten digits, 28×28). We scale pixel values to [0, 1], cast inputs to `float32` to match the model weights, and ensure targets are integer class labels.

```{python}
X, y = fetch_openml('mnist_784', version=1, as_frame=False, return_X_y=True)
X = (X / 255.0).astype('float32')  # inputs as float32
y = y.astype('int64')               # class indices as int64
```

# Train–test split

We create a stratified split so class proportions are similar in train and test sets.

```{python}
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, test_size=0.2, stratify=y, random_state=0
)
X_train.shape, X_test.shape
```

# Define the MLP model

We define a small MLP that outputs logits for 10 classes. Using a function (a "factory") lets skorch build a fresh model when it initialises.

```{python}
mlp = nn.Sequential(
        nn.Linear(784, 256),
        nn.ReLU(),
        nn.Linear(256, 128),
        nn.ReLU(),
        nn.Linear(128, 10)
    )
```

# Wrap with skorch and configure training

We use cross-entropy loss because the model outputs logits. The optimizer is Adam, and we train with mini-batches of 128 examples for 10 epochs on CPU.

```{python}
net = NeuralNetClassifier(
    mlp,                   
    criterion=nn.CrossEntropyLoss,
    max_epochs=10,
    batch_size=128,
    optimizer=torch.optim.Adam,
    lr=1e-3,
    device='cpu',
)
```

# Train the model

We fit the network on the training data. Skorch prints a compact training log each epoch.

```{python}
#| output: false
net.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

# Evaluate on the test set

We compute accuracy on held-out data. Returning the value in the last line displays it in this document.

```{python}
test_acc = net.score(X_test, y_test)
test_acc
```

# Inspect learned parameters (optional)

We can look at the shape of the first layer’s weights and confirm the model structure.

```{python}
net.module_[0].weight.detach().shape
```
