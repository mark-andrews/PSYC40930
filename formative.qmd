You will practice an end-to-end machine-learning analysis that mirrors Part 1 of the summative assessment.
You will get written feedback on strengths and actionable improvements.
This exercise is optional and ungraded.

## Task

Using a behavioural-science dataset of your choice, perform and report a binary classification analysis with a simple baseline model.
Use logistic regression or naive Bayes, or some other simple binary classifier, as the main classifier.
Follow the same workflow and report standards as the summative assessment.

## Requirements

* Report length: 4 pages excluding references and appendices.
* Tools: Python and Quarto.
* Reproducibility: single zip archive containing the .qmd, rendered html (and optionally pdf), Python source, data or a fetch script, and an environment file.
* Workflow: make one stratified 80/20 train/test split; run k-fold cross-validation on the 80% to tune hyperparameters; refit on the 80%; evaluate once on the 20%. If you prefer, use nested cross-validation.
* Metrics: report ROC-AUC and PR-AUC; include a thresholded confusion matrix with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1; state how you handled class imbalance.
* Baseline: include a trivial baseline (majority class) and compare it to your chosen model.
* Open science: pin package versions, fix random seeds, and provide exact commands to reproduce.

## What to include in the 4 pages

* A focused research question relevant to psychology or a related field.
* Dataset description: source, license, N, features, target, and any exclusions.
* Preprocessing summary: imputation, encoding, scaling, and leakage control via pipelines.
* Model and tuning: chosen classifier, hyperparameters considered, cross-validation setup.
* Results: the required metrics, a brief table comparing baseline vs model, and one figure (ROC or PR curve).
* Short interpretation and error analysis linked to the research question.

## Submission

Upload the single zip to the designated Dropbox by the stated date on the VLE.
Late submissions may not receive feedback.

## Feedback

We will use the same rubric as in the summative assessment. 
You will receive rubric-style comments on framing, methodology, validation, interpretation, and reproducibility.
Use this to improve your summative submission.
